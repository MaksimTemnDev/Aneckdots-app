## _The best android application for reading jokes and aneckdots_


It is full based on kotlin compose mobile app, which introduse you to the world of aneckdots.

- Chose the section you are interested to
- See the list of aneckdots
- If you enjoy this joke you can copy it, add to section favourite or go to author`s web page
- Of course you can switch to next joke or go to privious

##Tech part
In this project i use parser to get content from [web-site](https://www.anekdot.ru/). It works correctly by using a corountines and Flow. During this project i tryed to use a split in logic by a model part and view-controller part.
